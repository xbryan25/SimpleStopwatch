# SimpleStopwatch

## What this app does
- Supports the basic functionalities of a stopwatch, such as start, stop, continue, and reset.
- Can be minimized to a small window.
- Supports light and dark mode; it can be toggled according to preference.

## Limitations as of the latest version
- The application won't show up in taskbar when it is minimized (this is due to overrideredirect of 
customtkinter/tkinter).
- Not 100% accurate stopwatch functionality. SimpleStopwatch might be slightly (Â± 0.2 seconds) faster or 
slower when compared to another stopwatch. This is noticeable during longer periods of time.

## Python modules used in this repo
- customtkinter
- ctypes
- time

## Problems encountered
- Difficulty in loading digital clock font because of customtkinter's limitations, decided to not use other fonts 
for now.
- Getting the title bar to stay in dark mode, when switching from minimized to maximized version, the title bar 
changes color. (fixed!)
- Application lags when stopwatch is started, because of time.sleep(). (fixed!)
- Changing the icon in the taskbar and getting the icon to stay (and not disappear) when changing from light mode 
to dark mode (and vice versa).
